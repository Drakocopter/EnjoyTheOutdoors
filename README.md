# Capstone 2

This is the second Capstone of Pluralsight LCTA. We were tasked with creating a park and mountain search page. 
Given some data to display, we were to figure out how to display that data as requested. Here is my webpage for this project.

# [Home Page](html/home.html)!

As for the home page, I didn't have much that was required, nor did I have many ideas. 
So I just did an opening paragraph with some trees. That's really it. 

# [Park Page](html/parks.html)!
[parkspage](images/parkspage.png)
Here I implemented a dashed table to display the [nationalParkData.js.](scripts/data/nationalParkData.js)
I like everythiing to be centered, so the table as well as all the data is centered, which left some space around the edges,
so I added the trees to the edge, though getting them implemented was quite difficult, as I was having trouble cutting them off at the
sides and putting them at the edge of the page reliably. I eventually got it though. 

# [Mountain Page](html/moutains.html)!

The Mountain Page was more simple than the parks page because there was less required. As a result it took significantly less time than the parks page. The only issue was getting the image to center correctly and even then that wasn't that bad.

# Interesting Code
The most interesting code I wrote this project was getting the trees to format correctly. Adjusting the width in css determined how much of the tree was shown, and no cover allowed it to be placed over the edges of the webpage, ultimately giving a very natural feel as you scrolled the parks.
