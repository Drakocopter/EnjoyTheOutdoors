# Capstone 2

This is the second Capstone of Pluralsight LCTA. We were tasked with creating a park and mountain search page. 
Given some data to display, we were to figure out how to display that data as requested. Here is my webpage for this project.

# [Home Page](html/home.html)
As for the home page, I didn't have much that was required, nor did I have many ideas. 
So I just did an opening paragraph with some trees. That's really it. 

# [Park Page](html/parks.html)
Here I implemented a dashed table to display the [nationalParkData.js.](scripts/data/nationalParkData.js)
I like everythiing to be centered, so the table as well as all the data is centered, which left some space around the edges,
so I added the trees to the edge, though getting them implemented was quite difficult, as I was having trouble cutting them off at the
sides and putting them at the edge of the page reliably.
